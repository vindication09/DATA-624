#Chapter 4, Forecasting Principles and Practice, HA
## problems 7.1 & 7.3


## 7.1 Consider the pigs series — the number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria each month

* a) Use the ses() function in R to find the optimal values of  alpha and l0 , and generate forecasts for the next four months.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(fpp2)
library(ggplot2)

#summary(pigs)

summary(ses(pigs,h=4))
```

From the output, we observe the alpha to be 0.2971 and l to be 10308.58

* b) Compute a 95% prediction interval for the first forecast using y±1.96 s where s is the standard deviation of the residuals. Compare your interval with the interval produced by R.
